    "Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "Ans. Both classes and modules have their own attributes. In case of classes attributes can be used by creating an instance,          similarly by imporing a module, it's attributes can be used. Also, they have similarities in the way their attributes are        used. \n",
    "     class_object.attribute_name()\n",
    "     module_name.attribute_name()\n",
    "            \n",
    "Q2. How do you make instances and classes?\n",
    "Ans. classes are made using the key word 'class'\n",
    "     eg. class class_name:\n",
    "             pass\n",
    "     Instances are made using the class name of which it is being made.\n",
    "     eg. instance_name = class_name()\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Where and how should be class attributes created?\n",
    "Ans. Class attributes are created inside a class body but outside any function of the class.\n",
    "     class class_name():\n",
    "         attribute1 = 1\n",
    "         attribute2 = 2\n",
    "         #outside any function\n",
    "         def__init__():\n",
    "             pass\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Where and how are instance attributes created?\n",
    "Ans. Instance attributes are created inside the __init__() function of the the class. It is called automatically when an intance      is created.\n",
    "     class class_name():\n",
    "         def__init__(self,a,b,c):\n",
    "             self.inst1 = a\n",
    "             self.inst2 = b\n",
    "             self.inst3 = c\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What does the term \"self\" in a Python class mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Term 'self' refers to a pointer that points to the instance for which a particular function of the class is called. Without      this pointer compiler can not understand that values of which instance to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. How does a Python class handle operator overloading?\n",
    "Ans. Every operator has an associated function with it which is invoked whenever that operator is used. We can write define our      own behaviour for every operator but cannot create a new operator. \n",
    "     eg. class A:\n",
    "            def __init__(self, a):\n",
    "                self.a = a\n",
    " \n",
    "            # adding two objects\n",
    "            def __add__(self, o):\n",
    "                return self.a + o.a\n",
    "        ob1 = A(1)\n",
    "        ob2 = A(2)\n",
    "        ob3 = A(\"Geeks\")\n",
    "        ob4 = A(\"For\")\n",
    " \n",
    "        print(ob1 + ob2)\n",
    "        print(ob3 + ob4)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Output : 3\n",
    "                 GeeksFor\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. When do you consider allowing operator overloading of your classes?\n",
    "Ans. When we create our own class with our own behaviours it creates a data type for which the compiler does not know how to use      an operator. In such cases, we need to overload the operator with newly defined functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What is the most popular form of operator overloading?\n",
    "Ans. The add operator : '+'\n",
    "     If the operands are numbers it adds them : 1+3 = 4\n",
    "     But if operands are char/strings, it concatenates them : '1'+'3'='13'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What are the two most important concepts to grasp in order to comprehend Python OOP code?\n",
    "Ans.Inheritance and Polymorphism."
