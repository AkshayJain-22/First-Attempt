    "1. What is the result of the code, and explain?\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> X = 'iNeuron'\n",
    ">>> def func():\n",
    "        print(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> func()\n",
    "Output: iNeuron\n",
    "\n",
    "Explaination: We are calling a function named 'func()'. This func() function uses a print statement to ouput the result of a variable 'X' whose scope is available to func() therefore it is printing its value i.e. 'iNeuron'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the result of the code, and explain?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> X = 'iNeuron'\n",
    ">>> def func():\n",
    "        X = 'NI!'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> func()\n",
    ">>> print(X)\n",
    "Ouput: iNeuron\n",
    "\n",
    "Explaination: There are two Xs in the code. One lies outside the function func() which is called global X here. Other one is inside func() whose scope ends withing the function func(). So, when we print X outside the func() we access the global X hence we obtain 'iNeuron' as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What does this code print, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> X = 'iNeuron'\n",
    ">>> def func():\n",
    "X = 'NI'\n",
    "print(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> func()\n",
    ">>> print(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: NI\n",
    "        iNeuron\n",
    "        \n",
    "Explaination: Again, we have two Xs. One is global one which has the value 'iNeuron' and other one inside function func() whose scope is confined to func(). When we call func(), it prints the X which is defined inside it. On the other hand when we print X outside func() it prints the one with global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What output does this code produce? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> X = 'iNeuron'\n",
    ">>> def func():\n",
    "global X\n",
    "X = 'NI'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> func()\n",
    ">>> print(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 'NI' \n",
    "\n",
    "Explaination: The keyword global is used to access a variable with global scope. So inside the function func(), we have accessed global variable X and changed it's value from 'iNeuron' to 'NI'. Therefore when we print X we obtain 'NI'.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What about this code—what’s the output, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> X = 'iNeuron'\n",
    ">>> def func():\n",
    "X = 'NI'\n",
    "def nested():\n",
    "print(X)\n",
    "nested()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> func()\n",
    ">>> X\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: NI\n",
    "       'iNeuron'\n",
    "\n",
    "Explaination: We have a function 'nested()' which is nested inside another function 'func()'. Also we have two Xs, one is inside func() and other one is global (outside any function). So when the 'nested()' prints the value of X it is accessing the one inside 'func()'. Whereas, when we access X outside any function we are pointing at the global one. Accordingly, thier respective values are printed. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. How about this code: what is its output in Python 3, and explain?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> def func():\n",
    "X = 'NI'\n",
    "def nested():\n",
    "nonlocal X\n",
    "X = 'Spam'\n",
    "nested()\n",
    "print(X)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> func()\n",
    "Output: Spam\n",
    "Explaination: We have a function 'nested()' which is nested inside another function 'func()'. nonlocal keyword is used in the case of nested functions. This keyword works similar to the global, but rather than global, this keyword declares a variable to point to the variable of outside enclosing function, in case of nested functions.\n",
    "So, inside nested() it uses 'nonlocal' which changes the value of X (which was declared in func()) from 'NI' to 'Spam'. Therefore, Spam is printed in the output."
