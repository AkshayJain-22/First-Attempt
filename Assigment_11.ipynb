    "8. Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
    "Ans. Printing messages on the console makes it cumbersome for the user and the user is not interested in those messages. Also,      for complex scripts print() will not be able to give us a good idea of how the program is performing. logging messages          give us an ordered way to understand the functioning of the program and debugging errors.\n",

    "9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
    "Ans. Step Over - If the next line contains a function the function will be executed and the result returned without debugging                    each line.\n",
    "     Step In -  If the line does not contain a function it behaves the same as “step over” but if it does the debugger will                     enter the called function and continue line-by-line debugging there.\n",
    "     Step Out - It returns to the line where the current function was called.\n",
    "     \n",
    "10. After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop ?\n",
    "Ans. When it encounters a breakpoint or else, it will run till end.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n",
    "Ans. We set breakpoint to halt the program at any specific point where we want to check for something (values or conditions)          while debugging or at places where errors are likely to be encountered."
