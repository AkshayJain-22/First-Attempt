    "1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "Ans. This is used to define a list. Values seperated by commas(,) between these braces are assigned to a list as one element        each. If no elements are present it makes an empty list.\n",
    "     eg. l=[] is an empty list\n",
    "         l=[1,2,3,4] contains four elements.\n",
    "         \n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",
    "Ans. spam[2] = 'hello'\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?\n",
    "Ans. 'd'\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the value of spam[-1]?\n",
    "Ans. 'd'\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the value of spam[:2]?\n",
    "Ans. 'a','b'\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat', True] for the next three questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?\n",
    "Ans. 1\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "Ans. It will add another element to the list at the end with the value 99.\n",
    "     [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat', True, 99]\n",
    "     \n",
    "8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?\n",
    "Ans. It will remove the first occurence of 'cat' from bacon\n",
    "     [3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]\n",
    "     \n",
    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "Ans. list concatenation: +\n",
    "     list replication: *\n",
    "     \n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "Ans. append() adds any element at the end of the list.\n",
    "     insert() adds the element at any desired place in a list.\n",
    "     \n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "Ans.i) pop()\n",
    "    ii)remove()\n",
    "    \n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "Ans. A list is defined as an array of values stored under a common name. String is also a list but, all elements are of              'str' data type. Similar to lists, a srtring is an iterable object. Many functions of string class are similar to that of      lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "Ans. Tuples are immutable objects whereas lists are mutable. Tuples ensure a higher data security as compared to lists.\n",
    "     Additionally, Tuples enclose the values between '()' whereas, lists enclose the values between '[]'\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "Ans. tuple_name = (42,)\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "Ans. i) By type casting to tuple: print(tuple(list_name))\n",
    "     ii)By type casting to list : print(list(tuple_name))\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "Ans. A tuple is not a list but can contain list values as its tuple values.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "Ans. copy() creates a shallow copy of the object 'copy'. Any changes made to the 'copy' object will also be reflected in its        child object where it is copied. Its like creating an alias which are using same values as reference.\n",
    "     copy.deepcopy() creates a deep copy of the object 'copy'. Any changes made to this object will not be reflected in its          child object where it is copied.Here a completely new object is made with the values of 'copy' which can be changed            independently.\n"
