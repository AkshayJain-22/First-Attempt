    "When list and dictionaries are passed as arguments in a function call, so new list or dictionary is not made, infact a new alias is made which points to the same list or dictionary which was passed which is called pass by reference. It means that whatever manipulation is done on the alias, it would be reflected in the original list or dictionary also as both the alias as well as passed variable name are referring to the same data. Whereas, 'l' is an integer which is passed as by value, hence it's value will be copied to a new variable and any manipulation will not be refleced in the original one. \n"
