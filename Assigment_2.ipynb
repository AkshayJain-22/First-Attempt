    "1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "Ans. Two values are: True and False, They can be written using bollean operators or by type casting using bool() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "Ans. a)AND, b) NOT, c)OR\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).\n",
    "Ans.       And             OR           NOT\n",
    "       |A|B|Output|   |A|B|Output|   |A|Output|\n",

    "     \n",
    "6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "Ans. Assignment operator consist of a single equal sign (=) where as equal to operator consists of double equals sign (==)\n",
    "     Assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable. for example,\n",
    "     a=1\n",
